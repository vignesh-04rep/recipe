            <h4>Instructions:</h4>
            
            <p>
                
                Wash the Toor dal thoroughly and pressure cook it with 2 cups of water until it becomes soft and mushy.
            In a separate pot, add the chopped vegetables (brinjals, carrot, onion, tomato), sambar powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Add water and cook until the vegetables become tender.
            Extract tamarind juice from the soaked tamarind and add it to the pot. Simmer for 5 minutes.
            Mash the cooked dal using a spoon or whisk and add it to the pot. Mix well and adjust the consistency by adding water if needed.
            Heat oil in a small pan for tempering. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, dried red chilies, and asafoetida. Let them splutter.
            Pour the tempering over the sambar and mix well.
            Simmer the sambar for a few more minutes to allow the flavors to blend together.
            Serve the sambar hot with steamed rice or idli/dosa.
